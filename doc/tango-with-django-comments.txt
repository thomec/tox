Tango with Django 1.7

12.3.7 Modyfying the Registration Flow

Overriding the get_success_url didn't work for me as expected, instead I
associated the complete url to the index view in project/urls.py

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
		...
	>	url(r'/accounts/register/complete/', views.index),
		url(r'/accounts/', include('registration.backends.simple.urls')),
	)
